<h1>Orientation dependent anisotropic adaptive fuzzy diffusion based filter for restoration and enhancement of MRI Images</h1>

<h2>Objective</h2> 
The objective of this project is to present the design and development of a general
framework for restoration and enhancement of MR Image.

In MR image Rician noise is one of the prominent noise, however Gaussian and Rayleigh noise are also present. These type of
noises in the MRI can be identified by measuring SNR value of image data.

The proposed framework is a partial differential equation (pde) based nonlinear filter, which is obtained by casting the noise removal problem in to a variational framework. The proposed framework automatically identifies such type of noise present into the MR data and filters them by
choosing an appropriate filter which is adapted to a specific type of noise.
